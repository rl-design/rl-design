      <h1>- Project 4 -<br>Hats, Helmets, and Headwear</h1>
      <h2>11/07/2022 - Learning how to use the Soft Select Mode in Autodesk Maya</h2>
      <h3>In this project we will be making a hat, helmet, or headwear. The objective of this project is to familiarize ourselves with using Maya’s different camera perspectives, and Maya’s powerful Soft Selection Mode.</h3>

    <div class="header">
      <h2>Project Outline</h2>
      <h3>
      1. Let’s start by understanding the Soft Selection Mode. (4min 44sec video)
      <br>
      2. Then we’re going to try the 3 view modes and see how they help us model more effectively. (3min 14sec video)
      <br>
      3. With the skills learned above we’re going to use the skills above to make our Hat, Helmet, or Headwear! (19min 49sec video)
      <br>
      4. Your model should be inspired by something you're passionate about. Look up references online. Make something grounded and realistic, or make something absolutely non-sensical! I made a bicycle helmet as a demonstration but I want to see creativity and variety. Good luck!

      <h2>Let's review what we learned in the video about Soft Selection Mode.</h2>

    <div class="text">
      <h2>The Soft Select Mode allows us to organically select elements about the initial selection.</h2>
      <h3>
      1. Red represents the initial selection and will be manipulated with full effect.
      <br>
      2. Orange, yellow, or “colder” colors will be manipulated with decreasing effect, giving.
      <br>
      3. The result is a softer and smoother modeling of the polygon.
      <br>
      4. Try it on a flat plane in face mode!

      <h2>Changing the "Fall off" heatmap will change your selection.</h2>
      <h3>
      1. Keystroke “B” to activate / deactivate the Soft Selection Tool.
      <br>
      2. Holding down “B + Middle Mouse Button” for Windows.
      <br>
      3. “B + Middle Mouse Button” for Mac.
      <br>
      4. And moving your mouse from left to right will adjust the “Fall Off” or heatmap of your soft selection.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      With a basic understanding of the Soft Selection Tool, let’s start making a bicycle helmet! You can make whatever you want as long as it is you can wear it on your head so let’s follow along and have fun.

    1. I’m going to make a sphere.

    2. I want to make a dome so I’m going to change the sphere into Face Mode.

    <h2>Different view modes give you a more comprehensive view of your model.</h2>
    <h3>
    1. With Face Mode active im going to open the 4 Axis View by clicking the button circled in Red on the left panel.
    <br>
    2. You now have 4 different perspectives to edit your model from, giving you a more comprehensive view of changes made from every angle.
    <br>
    3. This is important because models can look deceptively different depending on the angle you view it from.

    <h2>Hit the delete button!</h2>
    <h3>
    1. And Delete the selected faces!
    <br>
    2. We made a quick and effective dome, as opposed to staying in single camera mode and panning around the object - individually selecting faces.
    <br>
    3. Think about different ways you can use different view modes when making your model!
