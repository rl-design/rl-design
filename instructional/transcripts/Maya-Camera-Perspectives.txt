00:00:00:14 - 00:00:29:55

So if you're coming from the video on the soft select mode and we're we're going to continue making our helmet. But before we do so, I'm going to need to go over something really important email and this is going to help us make our helmet. So first, I'm going to make a sphere. And what I'll be going over right now are the different views available to us in Mya.

00:00:30:50 - 00:01:00:16
Speaker 1
And by views, I mean camera angles. So right now we're in what's called single perspective view and over to the left you have these three different buttons that present to us three different views available. And so right now we're in single perspective view. I've just clicked it. And this gives us our camera. We only have one camera available to us for panning around to our options.

00:01:01:22 - 00:01:18:30
Speaker 1
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go into four view and four view gives us four different cameras. We have a camera here on top Y, which is giving us the view from the top of our model.

00:01:20:40 - 00:01:49:33
Speaker 1
We have a camera to the bottom corner over here called Front C, and this is giving us a view from the front. We have a camera over here called Side X, and this is giving us a view from the side right now. Our sphere pretty much looks the same in all the cameras. This is because, well, our sphere is going to look the same from all sides in our camera.

00:01:50:15 - 00:02:31:58
Speaker 1
But once we start making edits to our sphere, it's going to become apparent which ones from which ones to which one? Which camera is the view from the side? And so I'm going to quickly demonstrate that front perspective. This camera view is personally mine. I use a lot. This gives you a perspective. You where we can pan around and make note that these fixed camera views, they don't allow you to pan.

00:02:32:42 - 00:03:13:03
Speaker 1
That's because Mya wants to make sure that the front camera view will always be front camera view. You can always go to this cube of top and move your perspective around. Right now I'm just clicking, rotating my sphere. So great now that we know how to use the different views available to us and. We're going to go ahead and start making our helmet in the next video.
